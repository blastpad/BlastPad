# Contributing

Contributions are most welcome!   We welcome contributions of code (front-end and back-end), design, documentation, support, marketing, translation, SEO and more!  

This is a great open-source project for beginners whether you are new to programming or new to contributing to open-source projects.  We have good first bugs, mentored bugs, bugs for pair programming if you need some guidance.

We also welcome contributors of all levels.

# Coding Convention

 - Naming convention: one naming convention to rule them all. 
	All variable names, file names, folder names, etc. just follow one rule:  all lowercase, separated with underscores.
	Examples of valid names:
        foo
		foo_bar
		foo_bar_foo
		
	All names and table names are in the singular form instead of the plural.
		
 - Since this is a CMS / framework, I want to use as few external libraries as possible to keep the code lightweight.  That includes JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.  So, instead of using jQuery, use just plain old JavaScript as much as possible.
